In this Python Project, we will learn how to perform detection of credit cards. We will go through the various algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally, Gradient Boosting Classifier. For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, we will make use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.
